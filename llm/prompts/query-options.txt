Read the following code, locate the parts that implement **command-line argument parsing** (e.g., `getopt/getopt_long/argp/cxxopts/boost::program_options/clap/flag`, or any custom parser / table-driven option definitions), and then **enumerate the complete set of command-line options actually supported by the program**, including but not limited to:

* **Short options** (e.g., `-a`)
* **Long options** (e.g., `--all`)
* If a short/long pair maps to the same semantics, include **both forms** (both must appear)
* Only output options that are **truly supported by the implemented parsing logic**; ignore documentation/comments/options not wired into the parser

Notes:
* The output must be **JSON**. Output JSON only—no explanations.

Output examples:
```
["-a", "--all", "-b", "--batch", "-c"]
```
